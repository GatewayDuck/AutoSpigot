# AutoSpigot
Make a spigot server with a script



# How to install
Just the the command
```bash
$   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GatewayDuck/AutoSpigot/main/install.sh
```
```bash
$   bash install.sh
```

# OS
Works with most Linux based OS

Tested with Ubuntu 20.04 - 21.04

# System Requiments
A server running Ubuntu 20.04 (some other systems may work) with a minimum of 4GB RAM and 2 CPU Cores.


# Starting the server
To start the server cd into the dir
```bash
$   cd (dir)/minecraftServers/(serverName)/
```
then run
```bash
./control start
```
this will automatly start the server with 3GBs of ram (there is no way to currently change that)

if you are using the VPS you can use a program called `screen` to keep the server open even after u close out of ssh
